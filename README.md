# Front‑End Coding Challenge

(Vue 3 + TypeScript)

Build a small single‑page application that presents characters from the public **Rick & Morty API** (https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character).

## Core requirements

- Overview page that shows a paginated character list.
- Each list item has a **Delete** button; once deleted the character disappears immediately **and** stays gone after a page reload even when the API still returns it.
- Clicking a character opens a detail view with an image and further information.

Beyond that the choice of tooling, libraries, architecture, styling, state management and testing approach is completely up to you. Feel free to lean on modern productivity helpers —generators, code assistants— whatever gets the job done efficiently.

## Repository & workflow

- You receive an empty repository with this README on main.
- Work on feature/bug‑style branches; when you're happy, surface your changes in the usual collaboration‑friendly way so they can be reviewed at a glance.
- Keep commits small, meaningful and in English.
- Add unit or end‑to‑end tests where they add value; aim for relevance, not coverage numbers.
- At the end of this file include concise instructions on how to install, run and test the project.

## Small Tip

Characters you delete may appear again on later API pages. Make sure they never re‑appear **without pre‑loading the entire dataset**. But: the page size must stay fixed — so simply skipping deleted items isn't enough :)

## Working time

**This exercise is intentionally tight.** Budget **≈ 4–6 net hours (hard cap 8 h)** and stop when the box is empty. It is *not* a failure if some features remain unfinished—well‑structured, readable code and a clear Git history matter more than 100 % coverage.

When the time‑box ends, simply push what you have.

## Quick start

Good luck & have fun!
